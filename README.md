## About the inkrato platform

The inkrato platform has been used as a feedback platform for a wide range of uses - by activists (for the Labour Digital Goverment Review), charitable organisations (Friends of the Earth) for video game communites (PlanetSide Tracker), by private companies and by local community groups.

The release of the next generation client as open source software allows anyone to take advantage of it host a community site of their own, for free.

Commercial instances and bespoke versions are available on request. Commercial enquires should be sent to feedback@inkrato.com
